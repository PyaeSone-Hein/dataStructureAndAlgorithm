Method - Algorithms
An algorithm is a finite sequence of precise instructions for performing a computation or for solving a problem.

PROPERTIES OF ALGORITHMS

• Input. An algorithm has input values from a specified set.

• Output. From each set of input values, an algorithm produces output values from a specified set. The output values are the solution to the problem.

• Definiteness. The steps of an algorithm must be defined precisely.

• Correctness. An algorithm should produce the correct output values for each set of input values.

• Finiteness. An algorithm should produce the desired output after a finite (but perhaps large) number of steps for any input in the set.

• Effectiveness. It must be possible to perform each step of an algorithm exactly and in a finite amount of time. Generality. The procedure should be applicable for all problems of the desired form, not just for a particular set of input values.

LINEAR SEARCH
• Compare x (search item) successively with each term of the list until a match is found
• If item is found, return the location of that item
• Otherwise, return zero.

BINARY SEARCH
• Used when the list is sorted.
• List is then split into two smaller sublists of the same size
• Search continues by restricting the search to the appropriate sublist based on the comparison of
the element to be located and the middle term

Binary Search is more efficient than linear search.

SORTING
Sort the elements in the list in order (increasing, alphabetical, etc.)
